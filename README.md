# Dell 2010 – Empirical Analysis

This repository contains an empirical replication and extension of Dell (2010), focusing on the long-term effects of mining on economic development.
## Replication
- Fully replicated **Table 1**  and **Table 2** .
- Partially replicated **Table 3**.
- Used Dell’s original datasets.

## Extension
- Extended Dell’s analysis by examining the **long-term effects of the Mita on contemporary domestic violence**.
- Combined Dell’s historical data with **recent datasets from the Peruvian government**, focusing on indicators of gender-based violence at the regional level.
- Conducted econometric analysis (OLS, IV, robustness checks) to assess whether Mita regions show persistent effects on **domestic violence today**.
